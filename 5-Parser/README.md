# Compiler Design - Assignment 5
## Shrirang Prashant Deshmukh | 19CS01065

### Instructions for compiling
```
1. q1.cpp -> g++ q1.cpp
2. q2.cpp -> g++ q2.cpp
```

### Input format for grammar
    - Start Symbol
    - No. of non_terminals followed by each non-terminal in a new line.
    - No. of terminals followed by each terminal in a new line.
    - No. of production rules followed by each rule in a new line of format A->BC|Cae|#
    - Epsilon is represented by '#'
    
- For grammars with terminals/non_terminals with more than one character, call the transform_to_single_char_grammar function first.

### Folder Structure
```
|-headers
  |-grammar.h -> Functions for handling input, output and preprocessing of grammar.
  |-sets.h -> Set of functions to handle computation of first and follow sets of the given grammar.
  |-top_down_parser.h -> Functions to build and print parser table and parse a given input for the given grammar.
|-q1
  |-in
    |-grammar1.txt -> Input grammar
    |-input1.txt -> Input file that contains the string to be parsed.
  |-lex
    |-g1.l -> Lex file for identifying tokens in the input file and transforming them to tokens required in the parser.
    |-lex.h -> File generated by flex from the given lex file .
  |-out
    |-Grammar1.txt -> Initial Input Grammar.
    |-GrammarLL1.txt -> Transformed LL1 Grammar
    |-First-Follow1.txt -> Output file that contains the first and follow sets of the grammar.

  |-q1.cpp -> Main program file   
|-q2
  |-in
